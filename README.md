# Single Page Application
## What's this project about?
This project is about creating a Single Page Application using Bootstrap.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download five files:
   ·  index.html
   ·  home.html
   ·  blog.html
   ·  pricing.html
   ·  signin.html
- Notice that the index.html file is where the single page Bootstrap app will be mainly constructed, and where all the other content pages will be routed.
- In the home.html, blog.html, pricing.html and signin.html files is where the content of you single page application will be located to be hasched or routed in the index.html file.
- Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root , which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the directory where you save the files)
- Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
- Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser
- Also, you may need a local server to test the application, so in the terminal, in the directory where you save these files, run the command "npx serve" to get you own http server, which is commonly the http://localhost:3000/
  
## What's next?
There are plenty on new features that can be added to this single page application, so it can be adapted to the use case you want.
- Add buttons to the nav bar
- Add as many routed html pages as needed
- Personalize the style to the brand design
